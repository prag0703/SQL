1667. Fix Names in a Table
Easy

Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+
Output: 
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
   user_id,
   CONCAT(UPPER(left(name, 1)),LOWER(right(name, length(name) - 1))) AS name
FROM Users 
ORDER BY user_id
