608. Tree Node
Medium

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+

# Write your MySQL query statement below
#Path 1: Id is not in p_id = Leaf

SELECT 
    id,
    CASE 
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id NOT IN (SELECT p_id AS id FROM Tree WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Leaf'
        ELSE 'Inner'
    END AS type
FROM Tree

#Path 2: Id in P_id = Inner 
/*
SELECT 
    id,
    CASE 
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id AS id FROM Tree) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS type
FROM Tree
