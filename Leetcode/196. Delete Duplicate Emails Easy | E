196. Delete Duplicate Emails 
Easy

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+

# Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
DELETE p2 
FROM person p1
INNER JOIN person p2
WHERE p1.ID < p2.id and p1.email = p2.email

-- we are deleting p2, cause p1 table match with 1,john and p2 match with 3,john
-- hence, we need to delete higher id, according to question
