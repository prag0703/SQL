Input:

+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 2             | 10     |
| Leetcode      | Sell      | 5             | 9000   |
| Handbags      | Buy       | 17            | 30000  |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 3             | 1010   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 4             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 5             | 500    |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 6             | 1000   |
| Handbags      | Sell      | 29            | 7000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 10            | 10000  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
Output: 
+---------------+-------------------+
| stock_name    | capital_gain_loss |
+---------------+-------------------+
| Corona Masks  | 9500              |
| Leetcode      | 8000              |
| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. 
At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each 
('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH stock_buy_sell AS
(
SELECT 
    stock_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN operation = 'Sell' THEN price -- setting sell as positive value 
        ELSE -price -- making buy as negative so that when we addup all the transation, initial invetment will be subtracted
    END AS price
FROM Stocks
)
SELECT
    stock_name,
    SUM(price) AS capital_gain_loss -- Summing up all the transations by stock name | buy is negative so it will automatically deducted 
FROM  stock_buy_sell
GROUP BY 1
